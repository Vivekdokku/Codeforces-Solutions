# Codeforces Solutions

Welcome to the Codeforces Solutions repository. This repository contains solutions to various Codeforces problems, organized by problem difficulty and contest participation.

## Directory Structure

- **A-problems**: Solutions for the A-level problems.
- **B-problems**: Solutions for the B-level problems.
- **C-problems**: Solutions for the C-level problems.
- **D-problems**: Solutions for the D-level problems.
- **contests**: Contains solutions organized by codeforces.

## A-Problems

All solutions for the A-problems are stored in the `A-problems` directory. These are typically simpler problems and serve as a great starting point for practicing coding skills.

To access the solutions:

- Navigate to the `A-problems` folder.
- Each file within this folder corresponds to a specific A-level problem from Codeforces.

Example:
```bash
cd A-problems/

Note: The solutions in this repository are my own work, accumulated through both contests and individual problem-solving. I am continuously learning and improving, and I only share solutions that I have personally solved.
